Practical No. 5 – Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Aim:

To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for image classification on the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset, and compare its performance with a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

Theory:
1️⃣ Introduction:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model specifically designed for analyzing visual data such as images.
Unlike traditional MLPs, CNNs automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features — edges, textures, shapes — by using convolutional filters.

CNNs are highly effective for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and image classification.

2️⃣ Why CNN instead of MLP?

MLP treats all pixels independently and ignores spatial relationships.

CNN uses convolutional filters to extract local features like edges and corners.

CNNs have fewer parameters due to weight sharing and local connectivity.

CNNs generalize better and are computationally efficient for image data.

3️⃣ Architecture of a CNN:

A typical CNN includes the following layers:

Input Layer:

Accepts image data (e.g., 28×28 grayscale image).

Convolutional Layer (Conv Layer):

Performs convolution between the input and learnable filters (kernels).

Formula:

𝑌
(
𝑖
,
𝑗
)
=
(
𝑋
∗
𝑊
)
(
𝑖
,
𝑗
)
+
𝑏
Y(i,j)=(X∗W)(i,j)+b

Detects features such as edges and corners.

Activation Function (ReLU):

Adds non-linearity to the network.

ReLU(x) = max(0, x).

Pooling Layer (Max Pooling):

Reduces spatial size and computation.

Example: 2×2 max pooling reduces feature map size by half.

Fully Connected (FC) Layer:

Flattens features and maps them to the output classes.

Output Layer:

Uses Softmax for multi-class classification.

4️⃣ Advantages of CNNs:

Automatically learn relevant image features.

Reduce number of parameters through weight sharing.

Provide translation and scale invariance.

Achieve higher accuracy than fully connected networks for visual data.

**Algorithm:

-Normalize pixel values and create DataLoader objects for training and testing.

3.Define CNN Architecture:

-Add two convolutional layers (Conv2D) with ReLU and MaxPooling.

-Add fully connected layers to classify into output classes.

-Example:

Linear → ReLU → Linear → Output


4.Define Loss and Optimizer:

-Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

-Optimizer: Adam or SGD

5.Training Phase:

-For each epoch:

	-Forward pass: Compute output and loss.

	-Backward pass: Compute gradients.

	-Update weights with optimizer.

	-Record training loss and accuracy.

6.Testing Phase:

-Evaluate the model on the test dataset.

-Compute test loss and accuracy.

7.Plot Results:

-Plot training & test loss vs. epochs.

-Plot training & test accuracy vs. epochs.

8.Compare Results:

Compare CNN’s performance with a simple MLP.


Result:

CNN successfully classifies handwritten digits or images with high accuracy.

Loss decreases and accuracy increases with each epoch.

Example result:

Epoch 5/5: Train Loss = 0.042, Train Acc = 99.15%, Test Acc = 98.75%


CNN shows higher accuracy and faster convergence than MLP due to feature extraction via convolutional layers.

Conclusion:

CNN automatically learns spatial and local features of images, unlike MLP which relies on flattened input.

The use of convolution and pooling layers reduces parameters and improves efficiency.

The experiment proves that CNNs achieve better accuracy and generalization for image classification tasks.

CNNs form the foundation for advanced models like ResNet, VGG, and Inception networks.

Viva / Oral Questions and Answers:

Q1. What is a CNN?
A Convolutional Neural Network is a deep learning model designed to process and classify image data using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Q2. What is convolution?
Convolution is an operation where a kernel (filter) slides over the image to detect features like edges or corners.

Q3. What is the role of ReLU?
ReLU introduces non-linearity and helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem.

Q4. What is the purpose of pooling?
Pooling reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature map and helps make the model more robust to small image translations.

Q5. What is the difference between CNN and MLP?
CNN preserves spatial relationships using convolutions; MLP flattens the input, ignoring spatial structure.

Q6. Why is CNN better for images?
It captures local patterns, requires fewer parameters, and generalizes well for visual tasks.

Q7. What is padding and stride in convolution?
Padding adds extra pixels around the image to preserve size; stride determines how far the filter moves during convolution.
